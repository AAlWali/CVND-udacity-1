The structure of this Net class is shown below and left for you to fill in.\n",

    "# 1 input image channel (for grayscale images), 32 output channels/feature maps, 3x3 square convolution kernel\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice is to place any layers whose weights will change during the training process in `__init__` and refer to them in the `forward` function; any layers or functions that always behave in the same way, such as a pre-defined activation function, should appear *only* in the `forward` function."

For example, you might imagine a convolutional kernel that detects the vertical edges of a face or another one that detects the corners of eyes.
